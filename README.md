# refnx-models
Repository for user contributed code for the
[*refnx*](https://github.com/refnx/refnx) package. It's purpose is to hold code
fragments that are very specific to one type of experiment (such as an
interface *Component*), and therefore not suitable for inclusion in the core
*refnx* package itself, but are nevertheless worth sharing.

Each code contribution should come with a README file which at a minimum should
outline its purpose. The code fragment can come in a Python file, or a
'cleaned' Jupyter notebook (i.e. without the output cells). It's highly
recommended that the code be accompanied by an example of its use, including a
dataset.

Since this repository is not a core part of *refnx*, and the contributions are
from a diverse population, the veracity/correctness of each example is not
checked.

This collection of code fragments will be distributed under the BSD 3-clause
licence.
