# FreeformVFP

Creates a flexible ('freeform') profile which is constrained by the interfacial volume of material
(itself a fittable parameter). The profile itself can be constrained to be monotonic. This model
was designed to replicate the structure of a polymer brush, but would be well suited to any diffuse
interface where the interfacial volume can be approximated.
