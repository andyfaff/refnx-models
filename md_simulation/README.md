# MD Simulation

The code in this direct allows for the development of a X-ray or neutron reflectometry profile from a molecular dynamics simulation.
This code was used in the following publication:
```
"McCluskey, A.R., Grant, J., Smith, A.J., Rawle, J.L., Barlow, D.J., Lawrence, M.J., Parker, S.C. & Edler, K.J. (2019). J. Appl. Cryst. 52, https://doi.org/10.1107/S16005767180172"
```

Check that everything is working right before use by running the tests:
```
pytest test/test_md_simulation.py
```

## Additional requirements
```
pip install MDAnalysis
```
