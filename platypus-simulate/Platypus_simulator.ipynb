Its deficiency is that it doesn't take into account systematic errors (such as misalignment, gravity effects) and can't do background subtractions. The latter is done during an experiment to decrease $R_{min}$, which has the effect of increasing error bar size."

Of particular interest is the `rvs` method which randomly samples neutrons whose distribution obeys the direct beam spectrum. Random variates are generated the `rv_continuous` superclass by classical generation of uniform noise coupled with the `ppf`. `ppf` is approximated by linear interpolation of `q` into a pre-calculated inverse `cdf`.
