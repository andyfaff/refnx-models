# Batch fitting example

The Jupyter notebook in this example demonstrates the use of *refnx* to carry
out batch fitting of multiple datasets. The datasets are analysed independently
(as opposed to co-refinement). The example data comes from the
[*PLATYPUS*](https://www.ansto.gov.au/user-access/instruments/neutron-scattering-instruments/platypus-neutron-reflectometer)
reflectometer at ANSTO running in event mode for the study of real time kinetics.
The datasets correspond to a film swelling on exposure to a controlled partial
pressure of solvent.
