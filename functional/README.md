# Functional form example

The Jupyter notebook in this example demonstrates the use of *refnx* to create
a Component that has an exponential SLD profile. The code in `functional.py`
may be used as a starting point for developing SLD profiles of different
analytic forms by altering the `FunctionalForm.slabs` property/method.
